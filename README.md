# TechnoTrack Neural Networks. Spring 2021.
**Repository contains my solutions to the materials and homework that were offered during the [course](https://github.com/mailcourses/technotrack-NN2021S-lectures) on neural networks by MailRu Group and MIPT.**

# Implemented tasks
+ ## [Linear Regression class-based model with Vanilla SGD](https://github.com/grgera/TechnoTrack-NN/blob/main/Solutions/HW01_Gritsay.ipynb)
This task contains realization of classic linear regression fully on `NumPy` and almost providing `PyTorch` interface.

+ ## [Fully connected neural network with SGD](https://github.com/grgera/TechnoTrack-NN/blob/main/Solutions/HW02_Gritsay.ipynb)
Realization of fully connected neural network for MNIST classification with stochastic gradient descent as an optimization method. Also used only `NumPy` as a backend and model has a Sequential interface of `PyTorch`.

+ ## [Analysis of activation functions and optimization methods](https://github.com/grgera/TechnoTrack-NN/blob/main/Solutions/HW03_Gritsay.ipynb)
Realization of fully connected neural network for MNIST classification on `PyTorch` with different optimization methods and activation functions. Application of data augmentation and visualization with `TensorBoard`.

+ ## [Autocoders for Anomaly Identification](https://github.com/grgera/TechnoTrack-NN/blob/main/Solutions/HW06_Gritsay.ipynb)
Application of the convolutional autoencoder model to identify anomalies in the data. For more accurate training results, data augmentation is used.
